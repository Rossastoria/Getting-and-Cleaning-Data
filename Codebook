DATA SOURCE

The data was downloaded from: https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/getdata%2Fprojectfiles%2FUCI%20HAR%20Dataset.zip.

The observations are sensor readings from a smart phone along an array of features. The observation are divided into training 
and testing groups. Separate files contain the subject identification number, the motion subject was undergoing at the
time of the observation, and a file indexing the motion type with a numeric value. The script contained in this commit 
compilies those files into two tidy data sets.

VARIABLES

The variables are the sensoring readings which are indexed against 30 subjects undertaking one of six different possible
motions at the time of the observation of the sensor. Variables are classified as "features" and features have the characteristic
of measuring, for instance, the subjects acceleration in one of three dimensions at the time of observation. For the first data 
set, from the total list of features I remove all which are not the mean or standard deviation. For the second data set,
the data set is reshaped to report only the mean of each remaining feature.

OUTPUT

The first file (tidydata.txt) is a space delimited file which contains the mean and standard deviation features
for each subject undertaking each motion for both the training and test observations.

The second file (tidyavg.txt) is a space delimited file which reshapes the first file to report only the averages for 
each feature for each subject undertaking each motion.
